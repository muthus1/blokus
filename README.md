## Improvements

### Game Logic



### GUI

Rubric Item: Running python3 src/{g,t}ui.py 20 doesnâ€™t correctly 
display the board, start positions, and initial randomly selected piece

First, altered the way start locations are calculated by switching from x,y
to row,col for Points (Around line 96). Also, made alterations to the command
line code at the very end to assure gui can be ran with extra parameters.
